First we want to enable CSS Modules, so we run 'npm run eject'
in order to get access to the config file.

in order to use CSS Modules.
We can instead do this:
[Adding a CSS Modules Stylesheet](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet)
In a few words:
"CSS Modules are turned on for files ending with the .module.css extension".
